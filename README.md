# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes using various machine learning algorithms. It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Features

- Built and compared multiple ML models
- Focused on Logistic Regression and SVM
- Implemented user input testing
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Technologies

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset

- Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset  
- Source: Kaggle / UCI Repository

## How to Run

1. Open `.ipynb` file in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Use custom input values for prediction
